## About Me
I am currently an engineering student specializing in Data Science at the École de Science de l'Information. Throughout my academic journey, I have gained skills in data analysis, machine learning, and ERP customization using Odoo.

I have a strong passion for using data to uncover insights and building solutions to solve real-world problems. My internship at Doosys gave me the opportunity to work with Odoo ERP, where I contributed to projects like document management, OCR integration, and request handling.

In addition to my technical expertise, I am also an advocate for continuous learning and love exploring innovative solutions.

## Projects

### Odoo - Document and Request Management at Doosys
This project is part of my internship at Doosys. During my time there, I developed and optimized Odoo-based applications for managing customer requests and documents. The project consists of two main parts:

#### Gestion de courrier (Request Management):
I created customizable services for managing various types of customer requests and developed a system for clients to submit and track their requests through the company website.

#### Gestion et archivage de documents bancaires (Document Archiving):
This part of the project involved integrating OCR functionality for document archiving and improving the user interface for a more efficient and user-friendly experience.

### EDA - Student Spending Habits Analysis
This project was developed as part of my coursework. It aims to analyze student spending patterns using an open-source dataset from Kaggle. Through extensive data exploration, the project uncovers trends, relationships, and insights into how students allocate their finances. The analysis includes factors such as:

- Academic year
- Demographics
- Location

The insights from this analysis help to better understand student behaviors and spending priorities.
